But how good service, the atomic element, should be in the microservices system?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at 2 main attributes that help to build a good service in a microservices system:</p><h2 id=loose-coupling>Loose Coupling</h2><p>In microservices, a service should be independent. It doesn&rsquo;t require other services to start up or survives. Building and deployment process should be independent of other services.</p><p>From the code level, if a service changes the design, implementation, or behaviour; other services shouldn&rsquo;t change them.</p><p>Most of the mistakes to make in service coupling are using a shared database, code sharing, and synchronous communication without a circuit breaker.</p><h2 id=high-cohesion>High Cohesion</h2><p>Ideally, related behaviours should be together in a service. A service or module with high cohesion contains elements that are tightly related to each other and united in their purpose.</p><p>If we want to change a behaviour in the system, we should change it in one place. It will take time to deploy, and is riskier and more affected if it requires in many places.</p><p>The ideally is inherited from the single responsibility principle, that a service should be lived to do one job and change for one reason.</p></div><div class=tags>Tags: <a class=tag href=/tags/microservices>microservices</a> |</div></div></div></body></html>
