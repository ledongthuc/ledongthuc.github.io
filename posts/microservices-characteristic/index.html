<time>2022-04-24</time><div class=content><h1 id=what-are-microservices>What are microservices?</h1><p>Microservices are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture#Architectural_styles_and_patterns>architectural style</a> to design a system. They are small services that are independent and work together to build the system.</p><h1 id=why-small-service>Why small service?</h1><p>Big service, or monolithic system design easily creates complexity, and abstraction and depends on different logic.</p><p>Microservices recommend service should be small, simple and solve one thing well. It&rsquo;s the same idea as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle>single responsibility principle</a>.</p><h1 id=how-small-is-small-enough>How small is small enough?</h1><p>As we knew, we should keep services are small. But if they were too small, the communication would be more complex.</p><p>A lot of ideas about how to measure a service small enough:</p><ol><li>Keep a service as tiny as it can and can&rsquo;t break it smaller.</li><li>Keep a service small enough can to be re-write in a specific time (e.g. 2 weeks)</li><li>Keep a service only containing things that change for the same reason. Or one <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design>domain</a> per service.</li><li>Keep service can maintain by the smallest team in company org. And the smallest team size in a company is flexible depending on the company organization.</li></ol><p>In my personal opinion, (3) and (4) are what I recommend to decide how a service is small enough.</p><h1 id=how-are-services-independent>How are services independent?</h1><p>Services should be isolated from technology, deployment flow, execution process and operation system and business logic code. It avoids services side-effects from development to deployment, operation, and scaling.</p><p>Technology in services should be independent too. The service&rsquo;s tech-stack reason should be decided by how good it resolves the problem instead of existed tech-stack in other services. It provides services develop with their strongest reason.</p><h1 id=how-do-services-work-together>How do services work together?</h1><p>All communication between services is recommended through network calls that keep services independent from machine, OS, and file system. They can be HTTP, GRPC, websocket, webservices or event queue.</p><p>The communication shouldn&rsquo;t be OS interface, terminal command, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe>named pipe</a>, or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory>no-network shared memory</a>.</p></div><div class=tags>Tags: <a class=tag href=/tags/microservices>microservices</a> |</div></div></div></body></html>
